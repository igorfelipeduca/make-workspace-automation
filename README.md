# MakeDotCom - Automate your developer workflow

## What is MakeDotCom?

MakeDotCom is a platform that allows you to automate your workflows. It's a great way to streamline your development process and save time.

## How does MakeDotCom work?

MakeDotCom uses a combination of APIs and webhooks to automate your workflows. When you create a MakeDotCom Scenario, you can choose to trigger it when a specific event occurs, such as a new issue being created or a new pull request being opened.

When the event occurs, MakeDotCom will send a webhook to your app, which can then perform the necessary actions to automate your workflow.

## How can I use MakeDotCom to automate my development workflow?

MakeDotCom can be used to automate a wide range of tasks, such as:

- Sending notifications when a new issue is created
- Triggering a deployment when a new pull request is opened
- Sending automated emails to team members when a new feature is ready
- Automating tests when a new code change is made
- Integrating with other tools and services, such as Slack or GitHub

To get started with MakeDotCom, you can sign up for a free account on the MakeDotCom website. Once you've created an account, you can create your first MakeDotCom Scenario and start automating your development workflow.
